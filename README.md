# Difference between project and repository
Simply said, a "directory" where files and folders can exist is what a repository is. This "directory" can be copied by other people, who can then alter it as they see fit and ask for their changes to be incorporated into the main repository. A project however, contains issues and pull requests, keeping track of the work that needs to be done. Simply put, i can link my projects with many repositories in github.

# Branching strategy
The main branches that i am going to use for all projects, is the produciton and development branch. I only use a hotfix when theres a bug.
For all innovative capabilities a feature branch will be used for all projects, where necessary, utilizing the pull requests to merge feature branches into the main branch, maintaining an excellent, current main branch.

# .gitignore
The use of a .gitignore file is for notifying Git if there are any files that i want to ignore before commiting to my main repository

# Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Git sometimes stores data in caches.
You can erase sensitive data from the history after you commit it to a Git repository, such as a password. You can use either the open source BFG Repo-Cleaner tool or the git filter-repo tool to completely remove unnecessary files from a repository's history. But in terms of crentials and sensitive information, it is not advisable to store them in github since its purpose is to store code repositories only.
